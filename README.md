The Psychic Game


Rules: 

The user has to enter letters randomly and the computer will randomly pick letters as well. If the user's guess matches the computer's
then the user wins the game. If not, the user loses and the game resets and starts over agaim. 

I designed it so that the computer only guesses from the first half of the alphabet- so the user gets up to 12 guesses to make per round.
